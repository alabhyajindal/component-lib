# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **Butters in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new HTML file**.

### What you'll need

- An HTML file where you can link the component library and lots of creativity.

## Generate a new site

In order to use this library in your project,you need to copy the below link and paste it inside the `<head>` tag of your html file and use a predefined classes in your project.

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="">`

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Butters.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Butters site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
